# test_Monument
This is a repo to show how I code to the company Monument, as a test to my skills as an Automated Quality Engineer

How to work with this code:

- Clone this repository into a local folder of your preference;
- Install Playwright (globally);
- Run the tests using the following command line: npx playwright test ... (you can use the --project='chromium', for example, in order to run just in Chrome).
- Once the tests are done, see the report using the following command line: npx playwright show-report
